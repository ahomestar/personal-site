## About Me

I am a technical engineering leader (9 direct reports) at Apple since 2018, passionate about building **user‐friendly developer tools for ML engineers** to boost their productivity. My team built ML infra for model analysis, optimization, and testing, **which is mission-critical for the launch of Apple Intelligence ([Research post, Optimization section](https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/introducing-apple-foundation-models))** and **Vision Pro ([Paper](https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/talaria))**.

I received CS (HCI focus) PhD from UW, and interned at Google Research (with Kayur Patel on Colab) and MSR (with Meredith Ringel Morris). My first project at Apple was extending my PhD research to an ML-powered [iOS accessibility feature](https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/iphones-can-now-automatically-recognize-and-label-buttons-and-ui-features-for-blind-users/) that supports 20M+ blind people’s daily life.

Research Interests: **ML Developer Tools**, ML Model Optimization, UI Accessibility, HCI.

## Key Projects:
- **Auto-OPT:** ML infra to optimize all on-device Apple Intelligence LLMs.
- **Talaria:** Developer tool to enable Vision Pro ML models to run in low latency.
- **Screen Recognition:** Accessibility service to support 20M+ blind people’s daily life.
- **2 Best Papers, 3 Best Paper nominees, 5 Patents.**
